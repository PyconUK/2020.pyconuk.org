The [outline schedule](https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2020/schedule/) for the conference 
shows broadly what will be happening on each day.

*   On Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, there will be **Talk** and **Freestyle** sessions
    running in parallel.

    At **Talk** sessions, a speaker (or possibly more than one) will give a talk to an audience and they
    may take questions on their talk at the end.
    At **Freestyle** sessions, the session organiser might deliver a tutorial or workshop, lead a discussion
    or anything else they feel might be of interest.

    Everyone is free to attend whichever sessions they prefer (within the safe capacity of our rooms).

*   On Wednesday, we will have an all-day **Collaboration** session where attendees can work
    together on projects of their choosing.

Anyone can propose the content for a **Talk** or **Freestyle** session when our Call for Proposals opens
later in the year.
