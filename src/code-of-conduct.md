We want all attendees to have an enjoyable experience At PyCon UK. All attendees - delegates, speakers, volunteers, sponsors, exhibitors and organisers - are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct. If necessary, the organisers will act to enforce it.

**All attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the conference and at all conference events.**
This includes social and fringe events, whether officially sponsored by PyCon UK or not.

    <h3>Communication</h3>

    <p>
      All communication should be appropriate for a general audience, which may include children and people from many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery are not welcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      Please be thoughtful when making jokes or discussing sensitive topics or issues that are likely to have a strong personal effect on some people. If in doubt, ask for advice or simply moderate your expression.

    <ul>
      <li>sexist, racist or exclusionary</li>
      <li>intimidating or threatening</li>

## If there is a problem

If you are troubled by the behaviour of another attendee at the conference, or are concerned that another attendee may be in distress, please speak immediately to any member of conference staff or contact our code of conduct liaison volunteers. See [how to report a code of conduct concern](/code-of-conduct/how-to-report/).

Your concern will be heard in confidence, taken seriously, and dealt with according to a documented procedure for handling code of conduct reports.

Conference staff - volunteers and organisers - will be on hand throughout the conference. Any concern, whatever it is, will be immediately passed on to a member of the conference committee. The committee will investigate promptly and if necessary will take appropriate action. This could include:

*   asking a violator of the Code of Conduct to leave the event immediately (no refunds will be forthcoming)
*   passing on details of the incident to the [Python Software Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20150607144447/https://www.python.org/psf)
*   informing the police about the incident

We will provide you with a written statement of the outcome, whatever it is.
