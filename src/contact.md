## About the organisers

PyCon UK is organised entirely by volunteer members of the Python community in the UK.

The conference director of PyCon UK 2020 is **Kristian Glass**.

The conference is staged by **UKPA Trading Limited** (a company registered in England and Wales <a href="https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/12254310">no.&nbsp;12254310</a>) on behalf of **The UK&nbsp;Python Association** (a charity registered in England and Wales <a href="https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?regid=1173471&subid=0">no.&nbsp;1173471</a>).

## PyCon UK artwork

PyCon UK is very grateful for the original and characteristic graphic art produced for us -- as it has been for several years -- by [The Developer Society](https://www.dev.ngo). This includes our website, our logos and designs, and the instantly-recognisable Pythons that grace them.
