The [outline schedule](https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2020/schedule/) for the conference 
shows broadly what will be happening on each day.

*   On Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, there will be **Talk** and **Freestyle** sessions
    running in parallel.

    At **Talk** sessions, a speaker (or possibly more than one) will give a talk to an audience and they
    may take questions on their talk at the end.
    At **Freestyle** sessions, the session organiser might deliver a tutorial or workshop, lead a discussion
    , give a more in-depth talk than 30 minutes would allow or anything else they feel might be of interest.

    Everyone is free to attend whichever sessions they prefer (within the safe capacity of our rooms).

*   On Wednesday, we will have an all-day **Collaboration** session where attendees can work
    together on projects of their choosing.

Anyone can propose the content for a **Talk** or **Freestyle** session when our Call for Proposals opens
later in the year.
