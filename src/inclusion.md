title: Inclusion, diversity and accessibility

**Each year, we make an effort to ensure that PyCon UK is as welcoming, accessible, and inclusive as possible, and try to find new ways to make it even more so.**

If there is something you need, that's not described below, please [let us know](/contact/) so that we can do something about it.



## Child care 👶

PyCon UK will be a friendly environment for parents and babies.

  <h3>Free crèche</h3>

  <p>
    We will provide a free crèche, staffed by registered and qualified childminders, during conference hours.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can register for the crèche when buying your tickets.
    We need you to register in advance, so that we can book the appropriate number of staff for the crèche.
  </p>

  <p>
    Children will be welcome at all appropriate conference events, during breaks for refreshments and in the audience at talks.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="box box_red">
  <h3>Feeding your child</h3>

  <p>
    If you are breastfeeding your baby, we can provide a quiet room if that's what you prefer.
    Otherwise, please breastfeed your baby whenever and wherever you like, including during talks and at mealtimes.
  </p>

  <p>
    If your child is old enough to have meals and refreshments with us, they are welcome to join us. If they are not, you will need to provide their food.
  </p>
</div>



## Facilities and support for special needs

We have provision for people with hearing, vision and mobility requirements.

  <h3>Quiet room</h3>

  <p>
    We will provide a clearly-marked designated quiet room at the venue.
  </p>

  <p>
    This room is intended to be a calm and quiet place for anyone who needs to have a break from the bustle of the conference, and will not be used for socialising.

<div class="box box_red box_inclusion">
  <h3>Dress code</h3>

  <p>
    At PyCon UK we want everyone to feel comfortable, and that includes wearing clothing that makes you feel comfortable.
  </p>

  <p>
    For that reason, we do not have a formal dress code. As long as your outfit does not violate the <a href="/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a>, you are welcome to wear whatever suits you best.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="box box_yellow box_inclusion">
  <h3>Financial assistance</h3>

  <p>
    Some attendees will require a financial grant in order to meet the costs of travel, subsistence or even taking days off work. This can include discounted or free conference tickets.
  </p>

  <p>
    We run a financial assistance programme, and we will announce details soon.
