We welcome proposals from everyone. You don't need to be an expert, or an expert speaker. Below you can find about what kind of proposals we're seeking, but if you're in any doubt whether you should, please read [why you should submit a proposal](/cfp/why/).

On our [schedule](https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2020/schedule/), we have **Talk** and **Freestyle** sessions and you'll be asked whether you are proposing to run one of those, a social event or something completely different:

We have a team who will each score your proposal and we make our selection based on those scores. If you would like to know whay they are looking for and how to ensure you get the best score possible, please read our [proposal guidelines](/cfp/guidelines/).
