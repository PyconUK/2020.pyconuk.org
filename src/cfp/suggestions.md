title: Call for Suggestions Results
---
In 2019, we asked for suggested topics that people would like to see covered at that year's conference and we used the results when we were scoring the proposals we received.

We didn't feel it was necessary to ask for suggestions again so soon, so we'll be using those results again this year.

You can see the questions we asked and the responses at the [2019 Topics](https://2019.pyconuk.org/call-proposals/topics-pycon-uk-2019/) page.
