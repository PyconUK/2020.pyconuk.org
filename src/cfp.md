title: Call for Proposals
---

We welcome proposals from everyone. You don't need to be an expert, or an expert speaker. Below you can find about what kind of proposals we're seeking, but if you're in any doubt whether you should, please read [why you should submit a proposal](/cfp/why/).

On our [schedule](https://pretalx.com/pycon-uk-2020/schedule/), we have **Talk** and **Freestyle** sessions and you'll be asked whether you are proposing to run one of those, a social event or something completely different:

## Suggestions
In 2019, we asked for suggested topics that people would like to see covered at that year's conference and we used the results when we were scoring the proposals we received.

We didn't feel it was necessary to ask for suggestions again so soon, so we'll be using those results again this year.

You can see the questions we asked and the responses at the [2019 Topics](https://2019.pyconuk.org/call-proposals/topics-pycon-uk-2019/) page.

## Selection
We have a team who will each score your proposal and we make our selection based on those scores. If you would like to know whay they are looking for and how to ensure you get the best score possible, please read our [proposal guidelines](/cfp/guidelines/).
