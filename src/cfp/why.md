title: Why You Should Submit a Proposal 
---
## Everyone has something worthwhile to share
You might be a world-class expert or you might be a new beginner. Either way, you almost certainly have **something worth sharing** with other people.

It could be a story, a lesson, an idea, an experience, a protest, a discovery, a failure, a creation, a work in progress, a success, a challenge - **anything at all**.

The perspectives and experiences of new contributors are **just as valuable** as (and sometimes more surprising than) those of seasoned contributors.

## PyCon UK has a large and enthusiastic audience
Whatever it is you have to share, it's going to **strike a chord** with at least someone in our audience. Your contribution, however modest or specialised you think it might be, could be exactly what someone else has been waiting for.

A session at PyCon UK is an excellent way to **raise interest in a project**, **find new collaborators**, or to **draw attention to a problem**.

Our audience is **supportive, friendly and respectful**, and the attendees are there precisely because they want to hear about new things that they can become involved in and make a difference to.

## We're committed to making it a positive experience
We know how much effort and time our contributors put into their sessions. For many of them, it's a very big deal to stand up in front of an audience and speak publicly.

We want you to remember the experience as a positive one, and to **want to repeat it**.

We have a **speaker mentor scheme**, to help you prepare. We'll have a dedicated **speakers' quiet room** at the event. If you have any particular needs as a speaker, we'll do our utmost to accommodate them. We'll make every effort to ensure that our speakers feel that they have been an important part of **something valuable**.

## Our speakers keep coming back
People **love speaking at PyCon UK**, and keep coming back for more (typically, with increasingly ambitious and audacious proposals).

This includes many for whom it was their first speaking experience. There's hardly a better way to **build your skills and confidence** than by getting started at a PyCon UK.

## Our financial assistance programme prioritises speakers
If you need some help to attend, we have a substantial **financial assistance programme**. It's open to everyone, but **prioritises speakers**. Tell us what you need to make it possible to attend - it could be anything from a discounted ticket to funds to cover travel, accommodation and daily expenses - and we'll do our best to provide it for you.
