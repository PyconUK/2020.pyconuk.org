## PyCon UK 2020 has been cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and will be returning to Cardiff City Hall in 2021

Due to the current global situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken the decision to cancel PyCon UK 2020.

We very much hope the UK will be back to "business as usual" by October, but the uncertainty, and the ongoing impact during the busiest period of the organisational run-up, mean that we feel it would represent too much risk to us, our volunteers, and our attendees.

We know this will come as a disappointment, but after much consideration we feel it is the right course of action.

PyCon UK 2020 was looking like it was going to be an excellent event and we're truly disappointed that it won't be happening.
So many volunteers had already put in an incredible amount of hard work, and we'd like to thank them all for everything they've done.

Stay safe and stay healthy; here's to 2021!

With love,

The PyCon UK Team
